## Closures <a name = "closures"></a>

Closures! Probably the most powerful tool you can use if you ask me.
You probably used closures without even knowing it. If you have used higher order functions like `Array.prototype.map` or `Array.prototype.filter` you are using a closure.

```js
// the x is the inner function, we creating/using a closure
// the outer function will not have access to the inner

const xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

xs.map(x => x * 2) // [1,4,6,8,10]

xs.map(function (x) {
  return x * 2 // [1,4,6,8,10]
})

xs.filter(x => x % 2 == 0)

xs.filter(function (x) {
  return x % 2 === 0
})
```

Closure is combination of different function together, with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)
Closure give you access to a outer function score from a inner scope. The outer scope can not access the inner scope.

Think from the middle out, almost like `function composition` works.

The example below, when we call res, it wall always remember the first value that gets passed in, `x`. So no matter how many times we call the res with the second value `y` it will always remember what it `x` the first value.

```js
const handleAdd = x => {
  const add = z => {
    return x + z
  }

  return add
}

const res = handleAdd(10) // the 10 value will be set up to remember the initial call
res(20) // 30
res(10) // 20
```

Closures is very useful when we want to design/use the module pattern in javascript. If you coming from a more `oop` background using `java` ore perhaps `c++` you will be used with using classes. With the module pattern you could get a similar functionality with private and public values, just like you would in traditional `oop` languages

```js
function module(name) {
  // PUBLIC
  const speak = () => {
    console.log(name)
  }

  // PRIVATE
  const toUpper = str => {
    return str.toUpperCase()
  }

  // PUBLIC
  const shout = () => {
    console.log(toUpper(name))
  }

  return {
    speak,
    shout,
  }
}

const x = module("marcell")

x.speak()
x.shout()
x.toUpper // will not work because we don't have access to it
```

What gets return in the object is what we will be able to access sing the `x` constant.

Closures will bend your brain trust me, but they are so powerful, and probably the first thing you should focus on after you are comfortable with variables, loops, functions etc.
A good way to start is to read [Kyle Simpsons](https://github.com/getify) books [You don't know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

#### Call back function <a name = "cb"></a>

A callback is simply when you pass a function as a argument into another function, a good example of this when you use the `DOM` api and listen for some kind of event.

The second argument is our callback

```js
document.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("click")
})
```

We could also write it like this to make it more clear:

```js
const checkClick = () => {
  console.log("click")
}
document.addEventListener("click", checkClick)
```

Here is a example of how we can combine closures and callback together:

```js
const callbackFn = () => {
  let i = 0
  return () => {
    console.log("click", ++i)
  }
}

const anotherFn = fn => {
  fn()
  fn()
  fn()
  fn()
}

anotherFn(callbackFn())
```

## This keyword <a name = "this"></a>

<!-- The `this` keyword in `Javascript` has a specially place in every JS devs ðŸ¤£ . -->

## functional programing <a name = "fp"></a>

Benefits/Downsides with Javascript is that you can write in different kind of programing paradigms, we have the object oriented approach with `prototypes` that linking to each other, this how classes in javascript works under the hood, remember that classes does not work how they do in languages like `java` or `c++`.
We have a straight imperative approach where the code like almost like pure `c` code hehe, of course without the poointers and types but the logic look similar.
Then we have my favorite the `functional` approach, where we try to write and use pure functions, re use them, compose them to build our application. Like in a traditional `OOP`
approach we are relaying on inheritance while in `FP` we compose our functions.

#### Curried <a name = "curried" ></a>

**Where curried functions can be usefull in your front application**
You could preload a function with values that you then can controll via the last function, depending what you want to do. In react his could be for example sending a loaded function with values as a prop and and receiving it in the child component to control what you want to do with those values.
This was a real light bulb moment for me, when I realized how powerful curried functions are and how can use them in a useful way.
This is also so called `partial applications` just that we are useing 2 parameters in the first function.

**a simple example with vanilla js**:

```ts
let count = 0
const addListenerFn = (selector: string, eventType: string) => (listener: () => void) => {
  const element = document.querySelector(selector) as HTMLElement
  element.addEventListener(eventType, listener)
}

const incrementBtn = addListenerFn("#increment", "click")
const decrementBtn = addListenerFn("#decrement", "click")
const countEl = document.querySelector("#count") as HTMLHeadingElement

const renderCount = () => {
  countEl.innerHTML = `<span>${count}</span>`
}

incrementBtn(() => {
  count++
  renderCount()
})

decrementBtn(() => {
  count--
  renderCount()
})
```
