## Closures <a name = "closures"></a>

Closures! Probably the most powerful tool you can use if you ask me.
Closure is combination of different function together, with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)
Closure give you access to a outer function score from a inner scope. The outer scope can not access the inner scope.

Think from the middle out, almost like `function composition` works.

The example below, when we call res, it wall always remember the first value that gets passed in, `x`. So no matter how many times we call the res with the second value `y` it will always remember what it `x` the first value.

```js
const handleAdd = x => {
  const add = z => {
    return x + z
  }

  return add
}

const res = handleAdd(10) // the 10 value will be set up to remember the initial call
res(20) // 30
res(10) // 20
```
